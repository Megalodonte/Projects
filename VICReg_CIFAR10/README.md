Summary:

  - Aim of the project: Demonstration of VICReg method
  - Field: Self-Supervised Learning
  - Dataset: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
  - Model used: VICReg, ResNet

Note: for some reason github doesn't show properly the images in the notebook (apparently this is a common issue), so if you want to see the images you should run the corresponding markdown cells yourself.
